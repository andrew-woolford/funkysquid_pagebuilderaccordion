# Accordion module for Page Builder.

This was an old repo which we have used and updated for Funky Squid  purposes.

The original repo is located here [here](https://github.com/swimmer-zone/magento2-pagebuilder-accordion)

## Funky Squid updates

- Removed the PHP versions references so composer does not complain.
- Updated layout and styles to align with our current accordions designs.

## Updates which may be needed

- Check the code to ensure it's not using outdated code.
- Update code to use latest code for Magento 2
- Set accordion blocks to be closed by default
